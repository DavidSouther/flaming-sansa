Angular Graphing Library.

## Hacking

```
git clone
npm install
node app.js
```

The node app will print a banner. Visit that. Click around. Demos are listed
along the bottom tab bar.

### Adding a Demo

See current demos for sample code.

**Checklist:**

* [ ] Add a new module, `graphing.demos.name`.
* [ ] Add that module as a dependency to `graphing.demos`.
* [ ] Create a directive, template, and style sheets.
* [ ] Attach the directive as a child state of `demo`.
* [ ] Add a tab in `demos/template.jade`.
